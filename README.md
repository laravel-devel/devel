Devel is a modular Laravel platform which comes with an admin dashboard, a CRUD generator and a bunch of other useful tools. It is meant to make the life of developers a bit easier.

The modularity was achieved with the help of the [nWidart/laravel-modules](https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules) package, which was modified to the needs of Devel.

**PROJECT STATUS: NOT READY TO BE USED!** The project is in its early development stage. The dashboard/CRUD is incomplete and there are no any ready-to-use modules yet. Besides, breaking changes are made all the time.

- [Documentation](http://voerro.com/en/projects/devel/)
- [Live Demo](devel.voerro.com/dashboard)
    - `admin@example.com` / `qwerty123` - note that this user only has view/read permissions on the demo site and some features won't be visible at all

## Features

- Modular structure - organize your code into reusable modules, use modules made by other people
- All the custom Devel code comes with the project. Feel free to modify it to your needs.
- User roles and permissions system
- An admin dashboard built with custom Vue.js components
