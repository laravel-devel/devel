Devel (a **DEV**eloper's Larav**EL**) enhances Laravel in different ways making life of Laravel developers easier.

The Devel's main goal is to solve some of the common problems, minimize the routine of the development process, give projects a better structure. Devel can be used to develop regular web sites, as well as APIs/backends for Web Apps / PWAs / Mobile Apps. It comes with an admin dashboard too!

- [Documentation](http://voerro.com/en/projects/devel/) - features, installation, development, and more
- [Live Demo](http://devel.voerro.com/dashboard)
    - `admin@example.com` / `qwerty123` - note that this user only has view/read permissions on the demo site and some features won't be visible at all

## Project Status

**TRIAL AND ERROR STAGE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** The project is in its early active development stage. The dashboard/CRUD is incomplete and there are no any ready-to-use modules yet. Besides, breaking changes are made quite often.
